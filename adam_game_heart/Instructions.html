    In this game you will have to choose between <strong>three goods.</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For each good there are <strong>attributes.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Attributes</strong> are hidden within table cells.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will also have the possibility to <strong>like</strong> each good.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    In a nutshell, you will have to open the cells to find out more about each good.
</br>
    You have the possibility to say if you like the goods as you open each cell
    by clicking on a heart icon. </br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The heart is empty <img src="{{ static C.EMPTY_HEART }}" width="30px" style="display: inline-block;">
        </li>
        <li>
            If you click, it fills <img src="{{ static C.FILLED_HEART }}" width="30px" style="display: inline-block;">
        </li>
        <li>
            After 2 sec it empties again so that you can give another like.
        </li>
    </ul>
    You have 45 seconds until the matrix transposes.

    <i>Important: You can only give one like per box opened</i>
